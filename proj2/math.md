# Project 2 Math Problems

## Question 1: (5 pts) Parametric equations allow us to generalize geometry such as line segments and triangles to 3D. Of course, they also work in 2D. Find a parametric equation for the line y = 3x + 5. This line goes through the points (1,8) and (2,11). Use these points for your parametric equation. What is the vector associated with the line? How does this vector relate to the y = mx + b equation?

```
b.c. P(t) = A + (B - A)t
* P(t) = (1, 8) + (1, 3)t
* vector (1, 3)
* the y=mx + b line increases in the same direction as the vector.
```

## Question 2: (5 pts) What is the parametric equation Q(s, t) for triangle formed by the following vertices:

```
A = (5, 7, -1)
B = (7, 10, -2)
C = (4, 0, 3)
```

What are the equations for each of the three coordinates x(s, t), y(s, t), z(s,
t)?

```
P(t) = A + (B - A)t
```

## Question 3: (10 pts) Suppose the 3 vertices of a triangle have 3 different colors: A = gold, B = cornflower blue, C = forest green. Using color interpolation, what would the color of an interior pt corresponding to parameters s = 0.25 and t = 0.67? Specify colors in 0-255 RGB scale. Do actual coordinates matter for this calculation? Why or why not?

```
A = (255, 223, 0)
B = (100, 149, 237)
C = (1, 68, 33)
```

```

```

## Question 4: What is the color of point P in the interior of a line segment AB where P is a distance 1 from A and a distance of 4 from B? The point A is yellow and the point B is cyan. I suggest you solve this as a weighted sum; this will also help for the next problem.

## Question 5: What is the color of a point P in the interior of triangle ABD where P is a distance 3 from A, distance 3 from B, and distance 4 from C. The colors are RGB for A, B, C respectively. This problem is challenging â€“ the key insight is that the color will be a weighted sum, but what are the constraints on the weighted sum? Hint: one of these constraints is that the weights on two vertices (say, the weights on A and C), are inversely proportional to the distances from P to the two vertices.
